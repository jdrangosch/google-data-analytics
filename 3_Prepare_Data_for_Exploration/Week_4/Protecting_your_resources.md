# Reflection
Consider what you learned about data security in Kaggle:

What are some cases in which you should use the privacy, collaboration, and version control features on Kaggle?

What other scenarios can you think of where you might want to pin a different version of your notebook other than the most recent version?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

In case I want to work in a project by myself or with colaborators, but the project is not to be public yet or ever, is a case for a private project. Version control helps to keep the project organized, and to know every version code to find bugs or mistakes.
In the case of parallel working in a project one can fork it to version V101 and V201, and upgrading each version separately.

> Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would include how and when you should apply your knowledge of data privacy and version control when working in Kaggle.

> Understanding how to maintain privacy and record your progress with version control are essential skills for data analyst jobs, where you are often expected to collaborate with other analysts. Knowing about privacy standards and how to ensure effective collaboration will prevent you from exposing important data or losing precious work. Going forward, you can apply your knowledge of data security to other platforms or your future projects.
