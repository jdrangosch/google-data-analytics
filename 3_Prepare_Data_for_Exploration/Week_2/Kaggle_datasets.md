> Kaggle’s datasets and Data Explorer allow you to search for, access, and upload your own datasets. You can use Kaggle to conduct research, complete data projects, and share your accomplishments with other members of the data science community.

So far, you’ve learned a lot about how to use Kaggle to explore datasets. During this activity, you used this knowledge to find datasets you’re interested in. Keep those datasets in mind and in the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

What type(s) of data are in this dataset? Is this dataset biased or unbiased? How do you know?

Based on what you’ve explored so far, how might you use Kaggle’s Datasets feature to help develop your data analysis skills?

There are plenty of data sets to explore in Kaggle. The up side of this is variety, but the down side is that lots of sets are created/uploaded by their users so we don't know much about them, so we can not trust them fully.
It is a great source for data sets to practice basic skills and and to create dummy projects.

> Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! A strong response would include that Kaggle gives you access to tons of public datasets that you can use to practice data analysis and create your own projects. Beyond that, consider the following: 

> Online platforms like Kaggle allow you to search for, view, explore, upload, and work with datasets from a variety of sources and perspectives. Understanding how Kaggle works and how to use it will help you develop your skillset and grow as a data analyst.
