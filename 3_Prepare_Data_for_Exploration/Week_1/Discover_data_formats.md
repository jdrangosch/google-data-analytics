An entertainment website displays a star rating for a movie based on user reviews. Users can select from one to five whole stars to rate the movie. The star rating is an example of what type of data? Select all that apply.

Discrete    
Nominal   
Continuous    
Ordinal   

> The star rating is an example of ordinal data because the number of stars are in order of how much each person liked the movie. It’s also an example of discrete data because a person has to choose a full star measure; half-stars weren’t an option.
