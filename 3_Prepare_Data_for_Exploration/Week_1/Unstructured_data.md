# Unstructured data

Consider the doodles you found in the Quick, Draw! Dataset:

What do you notice as you explored drawings in different categories? Are there consistent themes among the pictures in a category? 

If you didn’t know the category labels, how would you distinguish the pictures from each other? What would you look for?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below. 

The theme is probably the same for each category. All drawings are really simple and they try to convey the category idea. This is because you only have 20 seconds to draw it while playing. In consequence every picture is really similar to each other.
All pictures are very similar to each other, so I would look for subtile things between each other so I can create a sub category.

> Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good response would include how the data (i.e., the drawings) are vastly different across these three categories. In each category, the pictures also vary by a wide margin, almost as much as they do between categories.
> Another thing to observe is that within a given category the pictures may be different, but consistent similarities persist. For example, virtually every picture of an elephant includes a trunk and big ears while pretty much every television will be rectangular and have an antenna.

Consider what you know about structured and unstructured data and how it connects to the Quick, Draw! website:

How would you describe the Quick, Draw! doodles you explored from a data point of view?

How are these doodles different from or similar to other types of data that you have previously encountered?

What about this data makes it unstructured?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

I would classify the data as Primary , Nominal and Unstructured data.
I have not encounter with this type of data previously.
Data that isn’t organized in any easily identifiable manner, because the categories are broad.

> Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would address that these doodles are unstructured data: Data that is either not organized or organized in a highly superficial manner.

> The data on Quick, Draw! is organized loosely based on the category, but not beyond that. Within each category, there is no organization. Unstructured data also has no established rule about how to compare two different pieces of data. On the other hand, structured data conforms to organizational rules.

> In the example of the elephant: there are no rules that make one picture more elephant-like than any other. Rules are one way to structure data, as they can act as a test to help determine if a data point (in this case, an image) should or shouldn’t be considered a picture of an elephant.
