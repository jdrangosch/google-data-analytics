# Introduction to Kaggle

Which statements are true about the two penguin datasets in the Dive into dplyr (tutorial #1) notebook? Select all that apply.

In penguins_lter.csv, the highest value in the column Sample Number is 152.
penguins_size.csv has 7 columns.
In both datasets, the number of columns is the same.
In penguins_lter.csv, the column Individual ID cannot be sorted.

> The penguins_size.csv has 7 columns. In penguins_lter.csv, the highest value in the column Sample Number is 152. To learn about the penguin datasets, you used an interactive notebook’s data viewing feature. Going forward, you can use interactive notebooks to examine and describe data. This is an important skill that will help you complete data projects in the future.

In this activity, you’ve learned a lot about data types and data structures. Using what you’ve learned so far, consider your experience with datasets and the two penguins datasets. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

Using all of the information you learned while exploring in Kaggle, how would you thoroughly describe these datasets to someone else?

How do you think sharing interactive notebooks online can help you develop your data analysis skills? 

Kaggle is an IDE similar to Jupyter notebook that let's you hold files, and run code.
I've worked with jupyter notebook and Google Colab with python for some time and they are really helpful.

> Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! You worked with notebooks and used different datasets in Kaggle. A strong response would include that online resources like Kaggle help data analysts accomplish many important tasks. Beyond that, consider the following:

> Data analysts use a variety of resources to complete data analysis projects. For instance, an analyst could use Kaggle notebooks to host projects in a portfolio. This is important for practicing and demonstrating your skills, as well as getting feedback from more experienced data analysts on your work.
