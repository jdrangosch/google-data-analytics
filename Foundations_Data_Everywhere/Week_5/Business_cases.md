# Overview

Now that you have explored how businesses use data in the real world, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider fairness and data use in three example business cases and respond to brief questions with your thoughts. 

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of fairness practices to scenarios that represent real-life business case studies. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Case Study 1 

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). 

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

### Reflection

Consider this scenario: 

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below. 

I think this analysis of the teachers who attended the workshop is fair since everyone got the chance to participate and it was voluntary. An unfair situation would have been that the workshop was in a schedule that not everyone could attend.
Almost every distribution of grades is a normal distribution, in this case they have different averages. It is probable that teachers that did not attend to the workshop got great grades, and teachers that did attend got awfull grades.
Accounting for that dispersion of values would be a good way to correct unfair practices and do not catalogue simply just by Attend/not attend.

### Correct

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude—as the administration did—that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating.

The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This group of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective.

It’s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.


## Case Study 2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions.

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

An unfair practice is just test the prototype during the daytime because the sensors and the video data are not fully tested in every daylight condition. They could correct the data just by testing the car during other hours such us night, morning and afternoon.
An example of fair practice is testing first in good wheather conditions and then progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions because you are testing the car for great-bad conditions over all, but first you are ensuring it works.
 
### Correct

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This case study shows an unfair practice. While the researchers test the prototype on three different tracks, they only conduct tests during the day.

Conditions on each track may be very different during the day and night and this could change the results significantly. The data analyst should correct this by asking the test team to add in nighttime testing to get a full perspective of how the prototype performs at any time of the day on the tracks.
 
## Case Study 3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey. 

They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

An unfair practice is to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because you would get an oversized population of visitors that want roller coasters because they are already in queuing for that ride.
To correct this process the survey could be online and they could survey visitors and ask them what new rides they are going to take and what they would like to use more.

### Correct

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This case study contains an unfair practice. While the decision to distribute surveys in places where visitors would have time to respond makes sense, it accidentally introduces sampling bias.

The only respondents to the survey are people waiting in line for the roller coasters. This may unfairly bias survey results, because respondents might prefer roller coasters. A data analyst could reduce sampling bias by distributing the survey at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. This would avoid targeting roller coaster fans and provide results from the park’s general audience.
