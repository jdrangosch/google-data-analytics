## The scenario: interview for a data analyst position
####
Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. First, they want to understand their customers’ ice cream flavor preferences. Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions. 

The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don’t know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?

Before responding to the question, you consider each step of the data life cycle.

## "Manager: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?"
####
We should have all of our customers identified with an ID number, and we shoul collect every purchase they make in detail. We should be storing: date and time, wheather, size or type of purchase, spent, absolute flavours, and proporcionate flavours. This could be done for on site purchases or through orders vía apps.
All the data should be stored in a Database and few people should have acces to the raw data, even if it is not sensible data, it should be protected.
The data can be analyzed in order to better understand customers purchases, flavours selection and ice cream stock inventory.
Once the model its created and tested, the results are checked and presented with the manager in a report, we can archive the data or destroy it.
