# Review the phases of data
&nbsp;
So far you’ve learned about the data analysis process and the data life cycle. They include the following steps:

### Data Analysis Process:

Ask
Prepare
Process
Analyze
Share
Act

### Data Life Cycle:

Plan
Capture
Manage
Analyze
Archive
Destroy

### Reflection

Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data:

What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

Reflect on your learning and think about how you can apply the phases of data to future projects.

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

First of all, the Data Analysis Process refers to the big picture, problem or question that it is trying to be solved. From the formulation of such problem or question to taking action in solving it. 
And the Data Life Cycle proces it refers to the specifics of how data is being handled in the specifics of the analysis.
In the ask phase of the Data Analysis Process the team must ask questions and define the problem that later in the plan phase of the Data Life Cycle the team must decide what kind of data is needed in order to answer the question.

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would consider the phases that data goes through in its life cycle and how this impacts the data analysis process.

While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’re going to get it.
