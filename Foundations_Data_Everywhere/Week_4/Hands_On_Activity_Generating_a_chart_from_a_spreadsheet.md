You have come a long way! You started recording your data manually, you loaded that data into a spreadsheet, and you visualized the data in a chart. Now, take a moment to examine your completed data visualization. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

How did you use a spreadsheet to help prepare your data? 

How did you format your chart to help you analyze your data?

in a spreadsheet every column is organized and ready to complete with raw data. In my case I had to copy and paste dates and values into cells, those could have been manually entered also.
The chart was a column chart that it very good to visualize daily/weekly/monthly/yearly information, also a line chart would have helped.

A spreadsheet helps you structure data in rows and columns, prepare data for analysis, and create custom data visualizations. To better analyze your data, you clean up your chart to make it more visually appealing and to clarify what data means by making your chart more descriptive. To do that, itâ€™s important to add chart titles and axis titles. Ultimately, this is an essential skill to master because clear, descriptive data visualizations help data analysts be great storytellers.
