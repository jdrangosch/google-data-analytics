# Completing your own SOW
Now that you know the basics, you can practice creating your own mock SOW for a project of your choice. To get started, first access the scope-of-work template.

### Fill the template in for an imaginary project
Spend a few minutes thinking about a plausible data analysis project. 

Come up with a problem domain, and then make up the relevant details to help you fill out the template. 

Take some time to fill out the template. Treat this exercise as if you were writing your first SOW in your new career as a data analyst. Try to be thorough, specific, and concise!

The specifics here aren’t important. The goal is to get comfortable identifying and formalizing requirements and using those requirements in a professional manner by creating SOWs. 

### Compare your work to a strong example
Once you’ve filled out your template, consider the strong example below and compare it to yours. 

### Confirmation and reflection

When you created a complete and thorough mock SOW, which foundational pieces of content did you include? Select all that apply.

When you created a complete and thorough mock SOW, which foundational pieces of content did you include? Select all that apply.

Budget
Deliverables
Reports
Milestones
Timeline

> In your mock scope-of-work, you should have included four foundational pieces of content: the deliverables, milestones, timeline, and reports. Once these items are in place, the SOW will help keep you, your team, and your project stakeholders organized and on the same page. Going forward, you can use this industry-standard tool to clarify a project’s business goals and how to accomplish them—just like a professional data analyst!

Now that you have put your scope-of-work knowledge into practice, take a moment to examine and reflect on your completed mock SOW. Then, review your work next to the strong example linked above. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

How did you identify and formalize the project’s requirements? 

What questions did you ask in order to update the foundational pieces of content?

First I asked a question that needed to be answered. And then completed the mock scope-of-work following close with the example given and modifying it.
I asked what was the problem that needed to be solved? how I could do It? what tools would I be using? and How to implement it in real ife. 

> Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! Although SOWs do not have a set format, they do include common foundational pieces of content. A good response would include how this content answers questions, sets expectations, and organizes activities. Beyond that, consider the following: 

Usually, projects don’t start until an SOW is approved with its key pieces of content: the deliverables, milestones, timeline, and reports. To collect and synthesize this information, analysts identify and formalize quantifiable project requirements. They use structured thinking to ask clarifying questions, define what to accomplish, and specify project boundaries.
