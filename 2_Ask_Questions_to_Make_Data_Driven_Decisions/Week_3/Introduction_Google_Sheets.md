I first started using Google Sheets when the competitor did not have an easy way to share so I had to use 2 products (Ms Excel and Dropbox).
For all purposes, Google lets me do the same or similar operations or functions as Excel.
Comment functions are great for people to share their thoughts on your document and also revision history. It let two people work on the same document at the time, and I use it with my students that way, I will be working on some part of the spreadsheet and they are working on another part.
