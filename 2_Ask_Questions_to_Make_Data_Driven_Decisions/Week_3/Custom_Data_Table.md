# Create a Custom Data Table
### Activity overview 
In this activity, you will import a dataset, build a custom data table, and use functions to analyze your data. For this activity, imagine you're a data analyst working for a recruiting agency. This recruiting agency helps all sorts of companies find skilled people to fill open data analytics jobs. The agency has collected data about job applications for opportunities posted on its website for the year 2019. 

The agency has asked your team to optimize its online application process. Your assignment is to summarize the agency’s job application data. In particular, you want to answer the following questions: 

What was the total number of applications received per month in 2019?

Which months had the least and greatest number of total applications received? 

What was the average number of applications received per month?

To do this, you’ll work with a spreadsheet. You’ll use spreadsheet functions to make calculations based on your data and create a custom data table to summarize your results. 

By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to import a spreadsheet file, sort data, create a custom data table, and use spreadsheet functions to work with your data. Spreadsheets are an essential tool for every data analyst. Using spreadsheets to organize and analyze data is an important skill that you will continue to develop throughout your career. 

What you will need
The agency’s data contains information about all of the data analytics job applications received in 2019. The data includes the following column headers: Applicant ID, Date, Job Title, Job Location, Hired, and Easy Apply. Below is a description of each column header and sample values.

### Confirmation and reflection  

Which of the following functions quickly counts how many items in a range of cells meet a given criterion? 

The COUNTIF function (correct)    
The TEXT function     
The MAX function    
The SUM function    

> The COUNTIF function quickly counts how many items in a range of cells meet a given criterion. Using functions to make calculations and analyze data is an important skill for a data analyst. Going forward, you will continue to develop this skill as you work with more complex datasets. 

In this activity, you learned how to analyze data using spreadsheet functions. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

How does using functions to make calculations help you quickly gain insights into large amounts of data?

How does creating a data table help you organize and communicate important aspects of your data?  

> Using functions, sorting data, helps me save time in doing stats or calculations.
> It helps in summarizing data, and having stats that represent it.

Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! In this activity, you imported a dataset, sorted your data, created a data table, and used functions to make calculations and analyze your data.  
Spreadsheets are an essential tool for every data analyst. Using spreadsheet functions to make calculations can help you quickly analyze large amounts of data. Creating data tables can help you summarize and communicate important aspects of your data. In upcoming activities, you will continue to explore the ways in which spreadsheet functions can help you work with complex datasets.
