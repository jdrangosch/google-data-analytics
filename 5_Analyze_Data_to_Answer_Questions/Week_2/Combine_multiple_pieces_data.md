# Hands-On Activity: Combine multiple pieces of data
### Confirmation and reflection
In an empty cell in the CONCAT function exercise spreadsheet, type the function =CONCATENATE(A7, " ", B7). What does this function return?

John Quincy Adams   
JohnQuincyAdams   
#N/A    
John QuincyAdams    

> The function =CONCATENATE(A7, " ", B7) would return "John Quincy Adams." The correct function to use here would be CONCATENATE, which you can use to combine strings. Using CONCAT with these arguments would resolve this correctly in Microsoft Excel, but return an error in Google Sheets. Going forward, you can use this distinction to write proper spreadsheet functions.

In this activity, you used spreadsheet functions to combine data. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

What are some other kinds of data you could combine using CONCAT or CONCATENATE?

What happens if a data analyst tries to work with dates or names that havenâ€™t been combined with CONCAT or CONCATENATE?
```
Using the CONCAT and CONCATENATE functions allow us to combine strings, numbers, and dates in order to compose longer strings that you can use in diferent ways, one use could be to create new unique identifiers for objects.
```
> Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! A good response would include how combining data with CONCAT and CONCATENATE helps you simplify and clean data by combining string data from multiple cells into a single cell. 

> In order to properly and efficiently analyze data, the data has to be clean and understandable. Data analysts use functions like CONCAT to make data easier to work with, which may require combining multiple cells. Coming up, you will learn more spreadsheet functions that will help you analyze data in spreadsheets.
