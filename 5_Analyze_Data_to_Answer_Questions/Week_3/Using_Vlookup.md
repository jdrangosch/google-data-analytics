# Using Vlookup Quiz
### Confirmation and reflection
Imagine the employee Anika Patel asks you to confirm her pay rate. Without using the pivot table, which VLOOKUP function would return her pay rate based off of the imported data on Sheet1?

=VLOOKUP(B19, B15:J19, 9, false)
=VLOOKUP(B20, B15:J20, 9, false)
=VLOOKUP(B19, B15:J19, 9, true)
=VLOOKUP(B19, B15:J19, 8, false)

> The VLOOKUP function =VLOOKUP(B19, B15:J19, 9, false) would return the value 3000, which is Anika Patelâ€™s pay rate. You can use VLOOKUP to find problems or inconsistencies like this in your data. Going forward, you can apply your knowledge of VLOOKUP to find, trim, and convert important information in large datasets.
