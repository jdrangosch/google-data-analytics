# Clean data using SQL
### Hands on
What is the maximum value in the price column of the car_info table? 

12,978    
5,1180    
45,400    
16,430    

> To ensure that the values in the price column fell within the expected range, you used the MIN and MAX functions to determine that the maximum price was 45, 400. Knowing this, you were able to clean this column and prepare for analysis. Going forward, you will continue to check columns with numeric data in BigQuery to make sure your data is clean. This will help you quickly identify issues with your data that might cause errors during analysis.


In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

Why is cleaning data before your analysis important?

Which of these cleaning techniques do you think will be most useful for you in the future?

It is not posible to obtain good analytics starting from wrong, dirty or incomplete data.
I think TRIM, LENGTH, MIN, MAX, DISTINCT are great techniques to find odd values in the data.

> Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! In this activity you checked your data for errors and fixed any inconsistencies. A good response would include that cleaning data is an important step of the analysis process that will save you time and help ensure accuracy in the future. 

> Cleaning data where it lives is incredibly important for analysts. For instance, you were able to use SQL to complete multiple cleaning tasks, which allows you to clean data stored in databases. In upcoming activities, you will use your cleaning skills to prepare for analysis!
