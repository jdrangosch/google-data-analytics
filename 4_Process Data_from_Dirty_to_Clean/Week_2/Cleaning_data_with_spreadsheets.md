# Cleaning data with spreadsheets
### Confirmation and reflection
Review the final product of the spreadsheet you cleaned during this activity. Which of the following is the rightmost column?

Column AZ   
Column Z    
Column AA   
Column AS   

> In the final product of this activity, the rightmost column is Column AS. You are able to find this information after you properly transpose the data. Going forward, you can apply what you learned about data cleaning and transposing to work with data in the future.

In this activity, you practiced cleaning and transposing data. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

What was the most challenging part of cleaning the data?

Why is cleaning and transposing data important for data analysis?

If you had to clean this data again, what would you do differently? Why?

I believe to have a clear vision or goal on how is the data supposed to look and what fields/values are important or primary and what fields are secondary.
Cleaning data is important in order to have a set of data you can work with, because dirty data is not useful. Transposing data can be helpful depending on what you are trying to achieve. In this example it is not very relevant.
In this example, I deleted entire rows of data because of blank values, in case I had to do it all over I would try to understand how to complete that data.

> Congratulations on completing this hands-on activity! In this activity, you cleaned and transposed data on a spreadsheet. A good response would include that cleaning is a fundamental step in data science as it greatly increases the integrity of the data. 

> Good data science results rely heavily on the reliability of the data. Data analysts clean data to make it more accurate and reliable. This is important for making sure that the projects you will work on as a data analyst are completed properly.
