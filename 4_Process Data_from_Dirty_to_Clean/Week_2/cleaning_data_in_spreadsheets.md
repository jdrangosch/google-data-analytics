A data analyst uses the COUNTIF function to count the number of times a value less than 5 occurs between spreadsheet cells A2 through A100. What is the correct syntax? 

=COUNTIF(A2:A100,"<5")    
=COUNTIF(A2:A100,<5)    
=COUNTIF(A2:A100,>5)    
=COUNTIF(A2:A100,">5")    

> The correct syntax is =COUNTIF(A2:A100,"<5"). COUNTIF will return the number of cells that match a value. A2:A100 is the range. And “<5” is the specified value.
